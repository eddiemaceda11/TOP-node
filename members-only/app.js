/**
 PROJECT OVERVIEW: I will be building an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside of the 
                   clubhouse, members can see who the author of the post is, but outside they can only see the story
                   and wonder who wrote it.
 PROJECT PURPOSE:  The will incorporate the lessons of authentication, databases, and SQL covered to combine into one project.
